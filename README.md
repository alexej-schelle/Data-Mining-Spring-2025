# Data-Analytics-Spring-2025
Python Source Code Files for the Data Analytics Course in Spring of 2025 (Constructor University)

This module introduces the concepts and methods of data analytics. The objective of the module is to present methods for gaining insights from data and drawing conclusions for analytical reasoning and decision making. The module comprises a broad spectrum of methods for modelling and understanding complex datasets. Comprising both descriptive and predictive analytics, the standard portfolio of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques is introduced. Automatic analysis components, such as data transformation, aggregation, classification, clustering, and outlier detection, will be treated as an integral part of the analytics process. As a central part of this module, students are introduced to the major concepts of statistical learning, such as cross-validation, feature selection, and model evaluation. The module combines and applies the theoretical foundation of data analytics with a practical exposure to the data analysis process.
