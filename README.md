# Data-Mining-Spring-2025
Python Source Code Files for the Data Mining Course in Spring of 2025 (Constructor University)

This module focuses on practical applications of algorithms and computational paradigms that allow computer-based search and detection of data patterns and regularities. Students learn how to use such tools to make predictions and perform predictions. Students will study data mining as the core component in the knowledge discovery in the database process which deals with extracting useful information from raw data. This knowledge discovery process includes data selection, cleaning, coding, using different statistical and machine learning techniques, and visualization of data and generated patterns and structures. The module aims to provide an overview of all these issues and illustrates the whole process with examples. A major component of the module is group-based participation in a data analysis competition. This competition allows students to apply the concepts learned in class and to develop the computational skills to analyze data in a collaborative setting.
